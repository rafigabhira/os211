# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [**SSD VS HDD**](https://www.minitool.com/backup-tips/ssd-vs-hdd.html)<br>
SSD VS HDD which is better to use in your PC? What's the difference between SSD and HDD?. This site explain easy to understand material when comparing both of them in simple way, especially is operating system.

2. [**Storage Structure in Operating Systems**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-structure-in-operating-systems/)<br>
This site tell the structure of storage in OS, include the Hierarchy.

3. [**Disk Scheduling Algorithms**](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~cs561/cs450/disksched/disksched.html)<br>
In operating systems, seek time is very important. Since all device requests are linked in queues, the seek time is increased causing the system to slow down. Disk Scheduling Algorithms are used to reduce the total seek time of any request. This site is very straightforward and easy to understand.

4. [**How Hard drives work**](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/harddrive.html)<br>
This website explain very detail about how hard drives can store our data. Include picture and video to add more visualization and each component. 

5. [**What is BIOS**](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system)<br>
BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is powered on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.

6. [**RAID**](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/RAID)<br>
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. That means that RAID is a way of logically putting multiple disks together into a single array. The idea then is that these disks working together will have the speed and/or reliability of a more expensive disk.

7. [**Process of booting**](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS24/Slides/Booting/Booting.html)<br>
The operating system is loaded through a bootstrapping process, more succinctly known as booting. A boot loader is a program whose task is to load a bigger program, such as the operating system

8. [**How SSD works**](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/solidstate-drives-work-makeuseof-explains/)<br>
These days, whether you're buying a new computer or upgrading an old computer, you'll want to buy a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a traditional hard disk drive (HDD). Indeed, switching from HDD to SSD is one of the best PC performance upgrades you can make.

9. [**Understanding systemd at startup on Linux**](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/systemd-startup)<br>
Systemd's startup provides important clues to help you solve problems when they occur.

10. [**Introduction to swap space on Linux systems**](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems)<br>
Learn how to modify the amount of swap space available on your Linux system, and how much you really need.
