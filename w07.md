# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [**Process Synchronization: Critical Section Problem in OS**](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources.This website give overview about what is critical section in operating system and why it become a problem.

2. [**Race Condition**](https://techterms.com/definition/race_condition)<br>
A race condition occurs when a software program depends on the timing of one or more processes to function correctly. This webiste give overview explanation about race condition.

3. [**Compare: Contrasting Peterson’s and Dekker’s algorithms**](https://qastack.id/cs/12621/contrasting-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms)<br>
This forum explains the difference between Peterson and Dekker's algorithm from multi perspective.

4. [**Semaphores, Monitors and Condition Variables**](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall11/cos318/lectures/L8_SemaphoreMonitor_v2.pdf)<br>
This website explain very detail and good explanation about semaphore. 

5. [**The Reader-Writer Problem in Operating System**](https://afteracademy.com/blog/the-reader-writer-problem-in-operating-system)<br>
In an Operating System, we deal with various processes and these processes may use files that are present in the system.This website provide comprehensive explanation about reader and writer problem with some execution code. 

6. [**Bounded buffer**](http://www.it.uu.se/education/course/homepage/os/vt18/module-4/bounded-buffer/)<br>
The bounded-buffer problems (aka the producer-consumer problem) is a classic example of concurrent access to a shared resource. A bounded buffer lets multiple producers and multiple consumers share a single buffer. This webiste provide brief explanation about bounded-buffer problem and some visualization to make better understanding. 

7. [**Multi-Instance Resource Allocation Graph**](https://dev.to/rahulmishra05/multi-instance-resource-allocation-graph-operating-system-m04-p03-15nh)<br>
This webiste give simple explanation about Multi-Instance Resource graph. 

8. [**Introduction to DEADLOCK in Operating System**](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource. This page discusses the mechanisms, such as deadlock prevention, deadlock avoidance, Difference Between Starvation and Deadlock, Advantages and Disadvantages of Deadlock method.

9. [**The Critical Section Problem**](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>
Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resources. This webiste give simple explanation about Critical Section Problem in OS.

10. [**Starvation Problem in CPU Scheduling For Multimedia Systems**](https://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/id/eprint/795/1/starvation.pdf)<br>
This is a website that provides information about Starvation in CPU scheduling for multimedia systems. Multimedia application refers to the capture, storage, retrieval and presentation of audio and video data using computers.
